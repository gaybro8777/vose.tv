Add routes to get any subreddit & bookmark the one you actually want
/r/:subreddit/:youtubeId

add top 25 videos of the day to a DB? Or use amazon style queries?

initial state of watched videos (not when a video is ready)?

video time length to thumbnails (like on youtube.com)

Improve route "split" eg: //r/videos is a valid url, but will split and make 'r' the subreddit

responsive design

next and prev buttons

add hot/top selector above videos

Double check that we do a good clean up for our components

use BEM

Messages:

- loading (done)
- Subreddit not found
- No videos found
- Subreddit private - Handle private subreddits (returns 403)

Add analytics

automatically set top 10 visited subreddits from analytics + all and videos
